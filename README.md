# Project 1: Covid-19 Data Exploration

This project explores the Covid-19 data with an emphasis on global death rates, infection rates, population impact, and vaccination trends. The data is pulled from a Covid-19 dataset, and multiple SQL queries are executed to derive insights using various SQL techniques, including joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, window functions, and aggregate functions. This data exploration is visualized and prepared for further analysis in tools like Tableau.

The project demonstrates the following SQL skills:

Joins: Combining data from multiple tables to extract meaningful insights.
CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Organizing complex queries for better readability and reusability.
Temp Tables: Storing intermediate results to perform additional calculations.
Windows Functions: Analyzing data within partitions, such as calculating rolling sums of vaccinations.
Aggregate Functions: Performing calculations like SUM, MAX, and COUNT on grouped data.
Creating Views: Defining views for consistent data access and visualization.
